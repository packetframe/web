Packetframe has a new control plane! ðŸŽ‰

To kick off the new year, the API, dashboard, and node orchestrator have been completely rewritten to improve the stability and feature set. (See the [api](https://github.com/packetframe/api), [web](https://github.com/packetframe/web), and [infra](https://github.com/packetframe/infra) repos for the full source)

Legacy accounts have been migrated to the new dashboard but will require a password reset due to a change in the argon2id hashing parameters. Head over to https://packetframe.com/dashboard/password_reset

Thank you to all our [community partners](/community) and beta testers for making this possible!
