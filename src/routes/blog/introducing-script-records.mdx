Ever wanted to define your DNS records as code? How about programmatically adjusting answers on the fly? Maybe you want to use your [favorite](https://github.com/natesales/q) [DNS](https://dig.lookup.dog) [query](https://www.knot-dns.cz/docs/latest/html/man_kdig.html) [tool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig) to decide which dessert to have?

_Introducing the SCRIPT record type!_

SCRIPT records contain a JavaScript function that's executed on each DNS query to determine the corresponding answer. Contrary to standard records that all DNS server implementations understand, `SCRIPT` isn't a valid RR type and isn't part of any normal DNS server.

Let's say you're in need of a tasty dessert but don't want to leave your command line:

```bash
~ $ dig +short TXT dessert.script.packetframe.com @script-ns.packetframe.com
"Salted Caramel Cake with Whipped Cream"
```

Under the hood, this is just a simple asynchronous JavaScript function that calls out to an API to retreive random desserts.

```js
async function handleQuery(query) {
  return await fetch("https://random-data-api.com/api/dessert/random_dessert")
    .then(resp => resp.json())
    .then(data => {
      return {
      "authoritative": true,
      "rrs": [
        {
          name: query.name,
          ttl: 300,
          type: "TXT",
          value: '"' + data["flavor"] + " " + data["variety"] + " with " + data["topping"] + '"'
        }
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

More practically speaking, SCRIPT records simplify popular GeoIP DNS routing and open up a whole new range of new DNS-based load balancing, DDoS mitigation, and traffic engineering possibilities.

We pass a `query` object to `handleQuery` and await the promise. Here's a quick example of what that `query` object currently contains:

```bash
~ $ dig +short +subnet=192.0.2.0/24 TXT query.script.packetframe.com @script-ns.packetframe.com
"{'name':'query.script.packetframe.com.','type':'TXT','subnet':'192.0.2.0/24/0','cookie':'d551f2af83ce9fda'}"
```

```js
async function handleQuery(query) {
    return {
        "authoritative": true,
        "rrs": [
            {
                name: query.name,
                ttl: 86400,
                type: "TXT",
                value: JSON.stringify(query).replaceAll('"', "'")
            }
        ]
    }
}

```

As always, the code behind SCRIPT records is entirely open source, found in the [api](https://github.com/packetframe/api) repo.

And no, this isn't a joke! Select the SCRIPT record type from the dashboard, try it out, and let us know what you build with them!
